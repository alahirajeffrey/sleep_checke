# sleep_checker

Lately, i have been unable to fall asleep without watching a series usually The big bang theory. While this is not ideal, it is not really a problem to me but i often fall asleep and leave my laptop playing the series into the night.

This script is a crude solution to that problem. Once it is started, it periodically send notificaions and if i fail to restart it after three times, it hibernates my PC.

It should be noted that this is not an elegant solution to the problem but it is a solution that works.

consequently, improvements may be made to make the script more robust and work as a windows service
